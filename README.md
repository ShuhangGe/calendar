### üß† Personalized AI Responses (Powered by Long-Term Memory)

**After the AI learns about you:**

*User:* "Schedule a meeting for tomorrow morning"  
*AI:* "‚úì Added to calendar: Tomorrow at 9:00 AM. I noticed you prefer morning meetings and usually have your best focus then!"

*User:* "What should I eat for lunch?"  
*AI:* "Based on your vegetarian preferences and your love for quinoa salads, how about trying that new Mediterranean place you mentioned wanting to visit?"

*User:* "I'm feeling stressed about work"  
*AI:* "I remember yoga classes on Wednesdays help you relax. There's one tonight at 6pm on your calendar, and you mentioned they always make you feel better."

**The AI automatically learns and remembers:**
- Your dietary preferences and restrictions
- Your work schedule patterns and meeting preferences  
- Your exercise habits and stress relief activities
- Your family members, friends, and important relationships
- Your allergies, health conditions, and medical information (encrypted)
- Your hobbies, interests, and personal goals

## üß† Enhanced AI Agent Workflow

The LangGraph workflow processes messages through these stages:

1. **Classification**: Determine if input is diary, calendar, or query
2. **Context Enrichment**: Add user history and retrieve relevant personal facts using vector similarity
3. **Processing**: Extract relevant information and format appropriately with personalized context
4. **Storage**: Save diary entries or calendar events to database
5. **Fact Extraction**: Background AI analysis to extract and store personal facts (preferences, habits, etc.)
6. **Response Generation**: Create personalized, context-aware confirmation messages

### Enhanced Features

#### Confidence Scoring
The agent calculates confidence scores based on temporal indicators:
- High confidence (>0.7): Direct processing
- Low confidence (<0.7): Request user confirmation

#### Fact Extraction Pipeline
- **Automatic Learning**: Every conversation is analyzed for personal facts
- **Category Classification**: Facts organized into personal, preference, work, health categories
- **Confidence Validation**: Only facts with >70% confidence are stored automatically
- **Duplicate Detection**: Smart merging prevents redundant fact storage
- **Background Processing**: Fact extraction runs asynchronously to maintain chat responsiveness

#### Personalization Engine
- **Vector Similarity**: Semantic search finds contextually relevant facts
- **Context Weighting**: Recent facts and high-confidence facts prioritized
- **Response Enhancement**: Base responses enriched with personal touches
- **Privacy Aware**: Sensitive facts double-encrypted and carefully handled

## üîí Security Considerations

### Core Security
- JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- User-scoped data isolation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting ready for production
- CORS configuration for mobile apps

### Long-Term Memory Security (NEW)
- **Per-User Encryption**: Each user's facts encrypted with unique keys derived from their password
- **Double Encryption**: Sensitive facts (health, financial) receive additional encryption layer
- **Key Rotation**: Encryption keys can be rotated without data loss
- **No Plain Text Storage**: Personal facts never stored unencrypted in database
- **Salt-Based Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations for key generation
- **Secure Vector Storage**: Embeddings stored separately from encrypted fact data
- **Access Logging**: All fact access attempts logged for security auditing
- **Privacy Controls**: Users can mark facts as sensitive for enhanced protection

## üöÄ Deployment

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### Environment Variables for Production
```env
# Core Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@db-host/calendar_assistant
SECRET_KEY=secure-random-key-256-bits
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-production-openai-key
ENVIRONMENT=production

# Long-Term Memory Configuration
FACT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=secure-fact-encryption-key-256-bits
CHROMA_PERSIST_DIRECTORY=/app/chroma_data
EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-ada-002
VECTOR_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.6
MAX_RELEVANT_FACTS=10
```

### Production Deployment Notes
- **Chroma DB**: Ensure persistent volume mounted at `CHROMA_PERSIST_DIRECTORY`
- **Encryption Keys**: Use cryptographically secure random keys (256-bit minimum)
- **Vector Storage**: Chroma database requires approximately 1.5MB per 1000 facts
- **Memory Usage**: Plan for ~500MB additional RAM for vector operations
- **Background Tasks**: Consider Redis + Celery for production fact extraction
